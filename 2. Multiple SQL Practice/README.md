## 🧱 My SQL Foundations & Query Design  

### 1️⃣ My SQL Essentials: The Big 6  
In this section, I review the **six core clauses** that I use in most of my SQL queries:  
`SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY`.  

I also revisit practical keywords that I rely on often, such as `LIMIT`, `DISTINCT`, `BETWEEN`, and `IN`, to control the number of rows returned, remove duplicates, and make my filters more precise. This helps me write cleaner, more efficient queries for my analyses.

### 2️⃣ My Multi-Table Analysis & JOINs  
Here, I focus on how I work with data spread across multiple tables using different types of **JOINs**:  
- **INNER JOIN** for rows that match in both tables  
- **LEFT / RIGHT JOIN** when I want to keep all rows from one side  
- **FULL OUTER JOIN** when I need a complete view from both tables  

I also review **self joins**, **CROSS JOINs**, and other variations that I use when I’m analysing relationships within the same table or generating combinations of records. These techniques help me answer more complex business questions with my SQL skills.

### 3️⃣ My Subqueries & CTEs (Common Table Expressions)  
In this part, I practise writing **subqueries** inside `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` clauses, as well as building **CTEs** using the `WITH` keyword.  

I focus on:  
- When I should choose a **subquery** versus a **CTE**  
- How CTEs make my queries more **readable**, **modular**, and easier to debug  
- Breaking complex problems into logical steps so my SQL stays clear and maintainable  

These patterns help me design queries that are not only correct, but also easier for me (and others) to understand and reuse later.
