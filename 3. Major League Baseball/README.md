# ⚾ MLB Player Analytics Project

## 🧾 Background  

You’ve just started as a **Data Analyst Intern for Major League Baseball (MLB)** and gained access to a rich historical database of player information. This dataset spans multiple decades and includes details such as:  

- Schools attended  
- Player salaries  
- Teams played for  
- Physical attributes (height, weight, etc.)  

Your overall goal is to analyse how **player statistics and characteristics have evolved over time and across different teams** in the league.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives  

As part of this role, you will investigate questions such as:

- **What schools do MLB players attend?**  
- **How much do teams spend on player salaries?**  
- **What does each player’s career trajectory look like?**  
- **How do player attributes compare across time and teams?**

To answer these, your analysis is broken into four main tasks.

## 📚 Task 1 – School Analysis  

- **(a)** For each **decade**, determine **how many schools** produced at least one MLB player.
